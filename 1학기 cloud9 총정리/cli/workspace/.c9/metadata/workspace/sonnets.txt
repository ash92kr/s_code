change thy thought, that I may change my mind:\nShall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?\nBe, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\n\nXI\n\nAs fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest;\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,\nThou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay:\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease\nAnd threescore year would make the world away.\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\nLook, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\n  She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\n\nXII\n\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night;\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\nAnd sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd,\nAnd summer's green all girded up in sheaves,\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard,\nThen of thy beauty do I question make,\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow;\n  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence\n  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.\n\nXIII\n\nO! that you were your self; but, love you are\nNo longer yours, than you your self here live:\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give:\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\nFind no determination; then you were\nYourself again, after yourself's decease,\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter's day\nAnd barren rage of death's eternal cold?\n  O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,\n  You had a father: let your son say so.\n\nXIV\n\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck;\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\nBut not to tell of good or evil luck,\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find:\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\nAs 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:\n  'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.'\n\nXV\n\nWhen I consider every thing that grows\nHolds in perfection but a little moment,\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment;\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky,\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory;\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with decay\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\n\nXVI\n\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?\nAnd fortify your self in your decay\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\nAnd many maiden gardens, yet unset,\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\nSo should the lines of life that life repair,\nWhich this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair,\nCan make you live your self in eyes of men.\n  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\n  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.\n\nXVII\n\nWho will believe my verse in time to come,\nIf it were fill'd with your most high deserts?\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts.\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\nThe age to come would say 'This poet lies;\nSuch heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'\nSo should my papers, yellow'd with their age,\nBe scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,\nAnd your true rights be term'd a poet's rage\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song:\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\n  You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.\n\nXVIII\n\nShall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd,\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,\nNor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,\n  So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n\nXIX\n\nDevouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood;\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,\nAnd burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,\nAnd do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets;\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime:\nO! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;\nHim in thy course untainted do allow\nFor beauty's pattern to succeeding men.\n  Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\n\nXX\n\nA woman's face with nature's own hand painted,\nHast thou, the master mistress of my passion;\nA woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted\nWith shifting change, as is false women's fashion:\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth;\nA man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,\nWhich steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created;\nTill Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\n  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,\n  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.\n\nXXI\n\nSo is it not with me as with that Muse,\nStirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,\nWho heaven itself for ornament doth use\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\nMaking a couplement of proud compare'\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,\nWith April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,\nThat heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.\nO! let me, true in love, but truly write,\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair\nAs any mother's child, though not so bright\nAs those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well;\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\n\nXXII\n\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date;\nBut when in thee time's furrows I behold,\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\nO! therefore love, be of thyself so wary\nAs I, not for myself, but for thee will;\nBearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\n  Presume not on th;heart when mine is slain,\n  Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.\n\nXXIII\n\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\nWhose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;\nSo I, for fear of trust, forget to say\nThe perfect ceremony of love's rite,\nAnd in mine own love's strength seem to decay,\nO'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.\nO! let my looks be then the eloquence\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\nMore than that tongue that more hath more express'd.\n  O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.\n\nXXIV\n\nMine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,\nThy beauty's form in table of my heart;\nMy body is the frame wherein 'tis held,\nAnd perspective it is best painter's art.\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\nTo find where your true image pictur'd lies,\nWhich in my bosom's shop is hanging still,\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\n\nXXV\n\nLet those who are in favour with their stars\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\nWhilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars\nUnlook'd for joy in that I honour most.\nGreat princes' favourites their fair leaves spread\nBut as the marigold at the sun's eye,\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\nAfter a thousand victories once foil'd,\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:\nThen happy I, that love and am belov'd,\nWhere I may not remove nor be remov'd.\n\nXXVI\n\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit,\nTo thee I send this written embassage,\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit:\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\nIn thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\nAnd puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect:\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\n\nXXVII\n\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;\nBut then begins a journey in my head\nTo work my mind, when body's work's expired:\nFor then my thoughts--from far where I abide--\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see:\nSave that my soul's imaginary sight\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\nWhich, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\n  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,\n  For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.\n\nXXVIII\n\nHow can I then return in happy plight,\nThat am debarre'd the benefit of rest?\nWhen day's oppression is not eas'd by night,\nBut day by night and night by day oppress'd,\nAnd each, though enemies to either's reign,\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\nI tell the day, to please him thou art bright,\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\nSo flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\n  And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.\n\nXXIX\n\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\nAnd look upon myself, and curse my fate,\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\nFeatur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,\nDesiring this man's art, and that man's scope,\nWith what I most enjoy contented least;\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\nHaply I think on thee,-- and then my state,\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate,;\n  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\n\nXXX\n\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:\nThen can I drown an eye, unused to flow,\nFor precious friends hid in death's dateless night,\nAnd weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,\nAnd moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o'er\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\n  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,\n  All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.\n\nXXXI\n\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead;\nAnd there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\nHath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear\nBut things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\nThat due of many now is thine alone:\n  Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,\n  And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.\n\nXXXII\n\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\nWhen that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,\nCompare them with the bett'ring of the time,\nAnd though they be outstripp'd by every pen,\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\nO! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:\n'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought,\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\n  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.\n\nXXXIII\n\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\nKissing with golden face the meadows green,\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide,\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow;\nBut out! alack! he was but one hour mine,\nThe region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.\n  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;\n  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.\n\nXXXIV\n\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\nTo let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,\nHiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?\n'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief;\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss:\nThe offender's sorrow lends but weak relief\nTo him that bears the strong offence's cross.\n  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\n  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.\n\nXXXV\n\nNo more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\nMyself corrupting, salving thy amiss,\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are;\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--\nThy adverse party is thy advocate,--\nAnd 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate,\n  That I an accessary needs must be,\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\n\nXXXVI\n\nLet me confess that we two must be twain,\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\nWhich though it alter not love's sole effect,\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\n\nXXXVII\n\nAs a decrepit father takes delight\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\nSo I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth;\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\nOr any of these all, or all, or more,\nEntitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\nI make my love engrafted, to this store:\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give\nThat I in thy abundance am suffic'd,\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live.\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:\n  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!\n\nXXXVIII\n\nHow can my muse want subject to invent,\nWhile thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\nO! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight;\nFor who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,\nWhen thou thy self dost give invention light?\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate;\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\n  If my slight muse do please these curious days,\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\n\nXXXIX\n\nO! how thy worth with manners may I sing,\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring?\nAnd what is't but mine own when I praise thee?\nEven for this, let us divided live,\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\nThat by this separation I may give\nThat due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.\nO absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\n\nXL\n\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all;\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.\nThen, if for my love, thou my love receivest,\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;\nBut yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest\nBy wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\nI do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\nAnd yet, love knows it is a greater grief\nTo bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\n  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\n\nXLI\n\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assail'd;\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman's son\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevail'd?\nAy me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\nAnd chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:--\n  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\n  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\n\nXLII\n\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly;\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye:\nThou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\nSuffering my friend for my sake to approve her.\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss;\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross:\n  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;\n  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.\n\nXLIII\n\nWhen most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,\nFor all the day they view things unrespected;\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\nThen thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,\nHow would thy shadow's form form happy show\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\nHow would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\n\nXLIV\n\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\nInjurious distance should not stop my way;\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay.\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\nUpon the farthest earth remov'd from thee;\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\nBut, ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\nI must attend, time's leisure with my moan;\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow\n  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.\n\nXLV\n\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide;\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\nMy life, being made of four, with two alone\nSinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;\nUntil life's composition be recur'd\nBy those swift messengers return'd from thee,\nWho even but now come back again, assur'd,\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me:\n  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,\n  I send them back again, and straight grow sad.\n\nXLVI\n\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight;\nMine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,\nMy heart mine eye the freedom of that right.\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--\nA closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\nTo side this title is impannelled\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;\nAnd by their verdict is determined\nThe clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:\n  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,\n  And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.\n\nXLVII\n\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other:\nWhen that mine eye is famish'd for a look,\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,\nWith my love's picture then my eye doth feast,\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart;\nAnother time mine eye is my heart's guest,\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part:\nSo, either by thy picture or my love,\nThy self away, art present still with me;\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee;\n  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\n  Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.\n\nXLVIII\n\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\nThat to my use it might unused stay\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\nThee have I not lock'd up in any chest,\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\n\nXLIX\n\nAgainst that time, if ever that time come,\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\nCall'd to that audit by advis'd respects;\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,\nWhen love, converted from the thing it was,\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here,\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part:\n  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,\n  Since why to love I can allege no cause.\n\nL\n\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\nWhen what I seek, my weary travel's end,\nDoth teach that ease and that repose to say,\n'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\nHis rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side;\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\n  My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\n\nLI\n\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence\nOf my dull bearer when from thee I speed:\nFrom where thou art why should I haste me thence?\nTill I return, of posting is no need.\nO! what excuse will my poor beast then find,\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\nThen should I spur, though mounted on the wind,\nIn winged speed n:motion shall I know,\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace;\nTherefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,\nShall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--\n  'Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\n  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'\n\nLII\n\nSo am I as the rich, whose blessed key,\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\nSince, seldom coming in that long year set,\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest,\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\nBy new unfolding his imprison'd pride.\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\n  Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.\n\nLIII\n\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\nSince every one, hath every one, one shade,\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend.\nDescribe Adonis, and the counterfeit\nIs poorly imitated after you;\nOn Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\nThe other as your bounty doth appear;\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\n  In all external grace you have some part,\n  But you like none, none you, for constant heart.\n\nLIV\n\nO!

that our night of woe might have remember'd\nMy deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,\nAnd soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd\nThe humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!\n  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;\n  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.\n\nCXXI\n\n'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,\nWhen not to be receives reproach of being;\nAnd the just pleasure lost, which is so deem'd\nNot by our feeling, but by others' seeing:\nFor why should others' false adulterate eyes\nGive salutation to my sportive blood?\nOr on my frailties why are frailer spies,\nWhich in their wills count bad what I think good?\nNo, I am that I am, and they that level\nAt my abuses reckon up their own:\nI may be straight though they themselves be bevel;\nBy their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;\n  Unless this general evil they maintain,\n  All men are bad and in their badness reign.\n\nCXXII\n\nThy gift, thy tables, are within my brain\nFull character'd with lasting memory,\nWhich shall above that idle rank remain,\nBeyond all date; even to eternity:\nOr, at the least, so long as brain and heart\nHave faculty by nature to subsist;\nTill each to raz'd oblivion yield his part\nOf thee, thy record never can be miss'd.\nThat poor retention could not so much hold,\nNor need I tallies thy dear love to score;\nTherefore to give them from me was I bold,\nTo trust those tables that receive thee more:\n  To keep an adjunct to remember thee\n  Were to import forgetfulness in me.\n\nCXXIII\n\nNo, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:\nThy pyramids built up with newer might\nTo me are nothing novel, nothing strange;\nThey are but dressings of a former sight.\nOur dates are brief, and therefore we admire\nWhat thou dost foist upon us that is old;\nAnd rather make them born to our desire\nThan think that we before have heard them told.\nThy registers and thee I both defy,\nNot wondering at the present nor the past,\nFor thy records and what we see doth lie,\nMade more or less by thy continual haste.\n  This I do vow and this shall ever be;\n  I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.\n\nCXXIV\n\nIf my dear love were but the child of state,\nIt might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd,\nAs subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,\nWeeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.\nNo, it was builded far from accident;\nIt suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\nUnder the blow of thralled discontent,\nWhereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:\nIt fears not policy, that heretic,\nWhich works on leases of short-number'd hours,\nBut all alone stands hugely politic,\nThat it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.\n  To this I witness call the fools of time,\n  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.\n\nCXXV\n\nWere't aught to me I bore the canopy,\nWith my extern the outward honouring,\nOr laid great bases for eternity,\nWhich proves more short than waste or ruining?\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favour\nLose all and more by paying too much rent\nFor compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,\nPitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?\nNo; let me be obsequious in thy heart,\nAnd take thou my oblation, poor but free,\nWhich is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,\nBut mutual render, only me for thee.\n  Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul\n  When most impeach'd, stands least in thy control.\n\nCXXVI\n\nO thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power\nDost hold Time's fickle glass, his fickle hour;\nWho hast by waning grown, and therein show'st\nThy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st.\nIf Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,\nAs thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,\nShe keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill\nMay time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.\nYet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!\nShe may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:\n  Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,\n  And her quietus is to render thee.\n\nCXXVII\n\nIn the old age black was not counted fair,\nOr if it were, it bore not beauty's name;\nBut now is black beauty's successive heir,\nAnd beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:\nFor since each hand hath put on Nature's power,\nFairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,\nSweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,\nBut is profan'd, if not lives in disgrace.\nTherefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,\nHer eyes so suited, and they mourners seem\nAt such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,\nSland'ring creation with a false esteem:\n  Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,\n  That every tongue says beauty should look so.\n\nCXXXIII\n\nHow oft when thou, my music, music play'st,\nUpon that blessed wood whose motion sounds\nWith thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st\nThe wiry concord that mine ear confounds,\nDo I envy those jacks that nimble leap,\nTo kiss the tender inward of thy hand,\nWhilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,\nAt the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!\nTo be so tickled, they would change their state\nAnd situation with those dancing chips,\nO'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,\nMaking dead wood more bless'd than living lips.\n  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,\n  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.\n\nCXXIX\n\nThe expense of spirit in a waste of shame\nIs lust in action: and till action, lust\nIs perjur'd, murderous, bloody, full of blame,\nSavage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;\nEnjoy'd no sooner but despised straight;\nPast reason hunted; and no sooner had,\nPast reason hated, as a swallow'd bait,\nOn purpose laid to make the taker mad:\nMad in pursuit and in possession so;\nHad, having, and in quest, to have extreme;\nA bliss in proof,-- and prov'd, a very woe;\nBefore, a joy propos'd; behind a dream.\n  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well\n  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.\n\nCXXX\n\nMy mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;\nCoral is far more red, than her lips red:\nIf snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;\nIf hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.\nI have seen roses damask'd, red and white,\nBut no such roses see I in her cheeks;\nAnd in some perfumes is there more delight\nThan in the breath that from my mistress reeks.\nI love to hear her speak, yet well I know\nThat music hath a far more pleasing sound:\nI grant I never saw a goddess go,--\nMy mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:\n  And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,\n  As any she belied with false compare.\n\nCXXXI\n\nThou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,\nAs those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;\nFor well thou know'st to my dear doting heart\nThou art the fairest and most precious jewel.\nYet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,\nThy face hath not the power to make love groan;\nTo say they err I dare not be so bold,\nAlthough I swear it to myself alone.\nAnd to be sure that is not false I swear,\nA thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,\nOne on another's neck, do witness bear\nThy black is fairest in my judgment's place.\n  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,\n  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.\n\nCXXXII\n\nThine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,\nKnowing thy heart torment me with disdain,\nHave put on black and loving mourners be,\nLooking with pretty ruth upon my pain.\nAnd truly not the morning sun of heaven\nBetter becomes the grey cheeks of the east,\nNor that full star that ushers in the even,\nDoth half that glory to the sober west,\nAs those two mourning eyes become thy face:\nO! let it then as well beseem thy heart\nTo mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,\nAnd suit thy pity like in every part.\n  Then will I swear beauty herself is black,\n  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.\n\nCXXXIII\n\nBeshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan\nFor that deep wound it gives my friend and me!\nIs't not enough to torture me alone,\nBut slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?\nMe from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,\nAnd my next self thou harder hast engross'd:\nOf him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;\nA torment thrice three-fold thus to be cross'd:\nPrison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,\nBut then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;\nWhoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;\nThou canst not then use rigour in my jail:\n  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,\n  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.\n\nCXXXIV\n\nSo, now I have confess'd that he is thine,\nAnd I my self am mortgag'd to thy will,\nMyself I'll forfeit, so that other mine\nThou wilt restore to be my comfort still:\nBut thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,\nFor thou art covetous, and he is kind;\nHe learn'd but surety-like to write for me,\nUnder that bond that him as fast doth bind.\nThe statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,\nThou usurer, that putt'st forth all to use,\nAnd sue a friend came debtor for my sake;\nSo him I lose through my unkind abuse.\n  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:\n  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.\n\nCXXXV\n\nWhoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'\nAnd 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus;\nMore than enough am I that vex'd thee still,\nTo thy sweet will making addition thus.\nWilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,\nNot once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?\nShall will in others seem right gracious,\nAnd in my will no fair acceptance shine?\nThe sea, all water, yet receives rain still,\nAnd in abundance addeth to his store;\nSo thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'\nOne will of mine, to make thy large will more.\n  Let no unkind 'No' fair beseechers kill;\n  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'\n\nCXXXVI\n\nIf thy soul check thee that I come so near,\nSwear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will',\nAnd will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;\nThus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.\n'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love,\nAy, fill it full with wills, and my will one.\nIn things of great receipt with ease we prove\nAmong a number one is reckon'd none:\nThen in the number let me pass untold,\nThough in thy store's account I one must be;\nFor nothing hold me, so it please thee hold\nThat nothing me, a something sweet to thee:\n  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,\n  And then thou lov'st me for my name is 'Will.'\n\nCXXXVII\n\nThou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,\nThat they behold, and see not what they see?\nThey know what beauty is, see where it lies,\nYet what the best is take the worst to be.\nIf eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks,\nBe anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,\nWhy of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,\nWhereto the judgment of my heart is tied?\nWhy should my heart think that a several plot,\nWhich my heart knows the wide world's common place?\nOr mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,\nTo put fair truth upon so foul a face?\n  In things right true my heart and eyes have err'd,\n  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.\n\nCXXXVIII\n\nWhen my love swears that she is made of truth,\nI do believe her though I know she lies,\nThat she might think me some untutor'd youth,\nUnlearned in the world's false subtleties.\nThus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,\nAlthough she knows my days are past the best,\nSimply I credit her false-speaking tongue:\nOn both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:\nBut wherefore says she not she is unjust?\nAnd wherefore say not I that I am old?\nO!
